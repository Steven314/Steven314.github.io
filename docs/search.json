    "text": "Recently, I was developing a model to predict a binary outcome. I settled on a logistic regression model since that was something I was somewhat familiar with from my Econometrics class. From a logistic regression model you estimate the probability of the observation belonging to the positive class. As one would guess, a probability greater than 50% would indicate the positive class, and below 50%, the negative class. This is the threshold value; the threshold where the classification changes from one outcome to the other.\n\\[\n\\hat{y_i} = \\begin{cases}\np(x_i) \\geq t, &\\text{then } 1 \\\\\np(x_i) &lt; t, &\\text{then } 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{1}\\] where \\(t\\) is the threshold value and \\(t\\in[0,1]\\)."

    "text": "Precision and Recall\nThere are many different websites that provide a definition for these metrics. You can easily find several detailed explanations with a quick search.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{Precision}&= \\frac{\\text{True Positive}}{\\text{True Positive}+ \\text{False Positive}} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP} \\\\\n\\text{Recall} &= \\frac{\\text{True Positive}}{\\text{True Positive} + \\text{False Negative}} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nIf we rearrange these definitions to solve for \\(FP\\) and \\(FN\\), we can make some progress.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Precision}\\cdot(TP+FP) &= TP \\\\\n(TP + FP) &= \\frac{TP}{\\text{Precision}} \\\\\nFP &= \\frac{TP}{\\text{Precision}} - TP \\\\\nFP &= TP \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{Precision}} - 1\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThe same algebraic process can be done for recall which gives,\n\\[\nFN = TP \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{Recall}} - 1\\right)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNow looking back to our objective, to make the quantities of Type I and Type II errors equal, we should set \\(FP\\) and \\(FN\\) equal to each other.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nFN &= FP \\\\\nTP \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{Recall}} - 1\\right) &= TP \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{Precision}} - 1\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\text{Recall}} &= \\frac{1}{\\text{Precision}} \\\\\n\\text{Precision} &= \\text{Recall}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nSo we see that our error types will be equal in quantity when our precision and recall are equal."
