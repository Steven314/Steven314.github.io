## Undergraduate Research Assistant | Oct 2022 - Aug 2023

### Projects

- Developed software for performing high quality electrical measurements with efficiency and precision. Improved experimental speed and consistency through software improvements and advances to the physical experimentation system.
- Developed workflows to improve quality and consistency for analyzing experimental data output.
- Performed electrical and optical photovoltaic measurements.
- See [below](#sec-publications) for papers in which the software I largely developed was utilized, even beyond my time of employment.

### Specialties

- Python
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

## Publications {#sec-publications}

For the 2024 and 2025 articles, I was a major contributor to the software used to perform the transient photovoltage/photocurrent experiments as well as developing scripts to automate initial analysis.
For the 2023 article, contributed a Python script to automate a basic analysis of some data; a relatively small part of the project.
