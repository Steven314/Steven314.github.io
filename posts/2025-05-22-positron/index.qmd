    Carl David Anderson led a very academically focused life. He spend his
    lengthy academic career at the California Institute of Tecnology and is
    credited with the discovery of both the positron and the muon. The existence
    of the positraon was predicted by Paul Dirac shortly before the discovery.
    Making use of a cloud chamber with a very powerful magnetic field, Anderson 
    was able to photograph particles within the chamber and study their 
    characteristics. The discovery of the positron was a breakthrough in 
    particle physics, earning Anderson a Nobel Prize. It was the first evidence
    of antimatter, which changed the face of 20th century physics. This sparked
    the search for other atomic particles, one of which was the muon, discovered
    in 1936. The positron has found use primarily in the medical field, where it
    is used to search for and monitor various diseases including cancer.

This was a writing assignment from the Modern Physics class during my final year of undergrad.
I unfortunately lost the original digital copy, so this is re-typed with very minor revisions and some adaptations to this format.
