# Notetaking

For electronic notes I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
With my Bible notes I backup the Obsidian vault with git to a [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) instance attached to a Raspberry Pi on my local network.

For physical notetaking I like to use a leatherbound notepad.
Any notes I take from Bible studies I try to copy into the Obsidian vault.

# Programming

I dabbled in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) for a while in 2024, but keeping [my setup](https://github.com/Steven314/nvim) up-to-date was too tedious for my liking.
I also couldn't make all the Neovim functionality on my work laptop which led to me ditching Neovim.

As a result and since the strong majority of my programming is with R and Markdown, I use [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/).
If I do something in Python or SQL, I gravitate toward [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for its better autocompletion and highlighting relative to RStudio for those languages.

## Languages

Currently I use R and Markdown/Quarto primarily and Python when R can't do the job.
In association with R and Python, I use SQL both directly and through [`{dplyr}` backends](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html#backends).

| Language | Proficiency | Experience |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| R        | Strong      | 2 years    |
| Markdown, Quarto | Strong | 2 years |
| SQL      | Moderate    | 1 year     |
| Python   | Moderate    | 1.5 years  |
| LaTeX    | Moderate    | 1 year     |
| Java     | Basic       | 2 Semesters |
| HTML     | Basic       | Minimal    |
| CSS      | Basic       | Minimal    |
| DAX      | Basic       | Minimal    |
| JavaScript | Near Zero | Next to none |

## Software

- **RStudio**: This is my go-to editor for writing reports and apps with Quarto and Shiny. The open-source community is really thriving and makes the R language very approachable. A big plus is the Vim motions as I use a weird combination of Vim motions and keyboard macros. 

- **VS Code**: I use this for miscellaneous code editing and any Python work. It is a good editor, but doesn't fit into my usual workflow.
    - **Positron**: It's a weird cross between RStudio and VS Code.
    - **Windsurf**: Basically VS Code with AI. The AI portion is kind of in the way. It is useful for file paths and tedious repitive edits, but I don't find it at all helpful for real analysis.

- **Power BI**: I am not a fan of any Microsoft data analysis software. It feels restrictive to do anything outside of basic charts and graphs. I always feel that I am fighting the program to get what I want. Being locked down in closed-source, paid ecosystem is a big negative. The documentation is severly lacking compared to that of the R community.
    - **DAX**: This is terrible. Just terrible.
    - **SQL Server Analysis Server**: It uses DAX. It's okay.

- **Tableau**: Similar thoughts to Power BI, but I have generally had a better experience. However, I haven't used it as much.

- **ArcGIS**: I only used this for a class. It was an alright experience, but I haven't done any complex work to feel out the program yet. All of my mapping needs recently have been filled by [`{plotly}`](https://plotly.com/r/maps/) and [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html).

- **Obsidian**: This is a good and adaptable notetaking software.

- [**DuckDB**](https://duckdb.org/): This is a good database software. I used it extensively in January 2025 and had no performance issue or major problems.

# Keyboard

I use a [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) with [Cherry MX Silent Reds](https://www.cherry.de/en-us/product/mx2a-silent-red).
I also use a [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) layout with some macros and layers.
My full layout is available on [Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/jYavJ/latest/0).
